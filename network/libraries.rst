``Pcapy`` and ``libpcap``
=========================
* Python libpcap module is a low-level binding for libpcap C library.
* http://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/pcap.3pcap.html
* https://nmap.org/npcap/
* https://www.secureauth.com/labs/open-source-tools/pcapy
* Pcapy is a Python extension module that interfaces with the libpcap packet capture library.
* Pcapy enables python scripts to capture packets on the network.
* Pcapy is highly effective when used in conjunction with a packet-handling package such as Impacket, which is a collection of Python classes for constructing and dissecting network packets.


``Dpkt``
========
* fast, simple packet creation / parsing, with definitions for the basic TCP/IP protocols
* https://dpkt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


``Scanpy``
==========


``Twisted``
===========
* An extensible framework for Python programming, with special focus on event-based network programming and multiprotocol integration.
* Twisted includes lots and lots of protocol implementations, meaning that more likely than not there will be an API you can use to talk to some remote system (either client or server in most cases) - be it:

    * HTTP
    * FTP
    * SMTP
    * POP3
    * IMAP4
    * DNS
    * IRC
    * MSN
    * OSCAR
    * XMPP/Jabber
    * telnet
    * SSH
    * SSL
    * NNTP
    * Finger
    * ident
    * lower level protocol-building-protocols like DJB's netstrings
    * simple line-oriented protocols
    * Twisted's custom protocols like Perspective Broker (PB) or Asynchronous Messaging Protocol (AMP).

* none of this functionality is implemented by blocking on the network

        def lineReceived(self, line):
            for c in self.factory.clients:
                host = self.transport.getHost()
                source = f"<{host}> ".encode()
                c.sendLine(source + line)


    class PubFactory(protocol.Factory):

    from twisted.python import failure


    @defer.inlineCallbacks
    def main(reactor, username=b"alice", password=b"secret",
             strport="tls:example.com:993"):

        endpoint = endpoints.clientFromString(reactor, strport)
        factory = protocol.Factory.forProtocol(imap4.IMAP4Client)

        try:
            client = yield endpoint.connect(factory)
            yield client.login(username, password)
            yield client.select('INBOX')

            failure.Failure().printTraceback()

``Pyro4``
=========
* https://github.com/irmen/Pyro4
* https://pyro4.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
* Pyro means PYthon Remote Objects.
* It is a library that enables you to build applications in which objects can talk to eachother over the network, with minimal programming effort.
* You can just use normal Python method calls, with almost every possible parameter and return value type, and Pyro takes care of locating the right object on the right computer to execute the method.
* It is designed to be very easy to use, and to generally stay out of your way.
* But it also provides a set of powerful features that enables you to build distributed applications rapidly and effortlessly.
* Pyro is a pure Python library and runs on many different platforms and Python versions.
